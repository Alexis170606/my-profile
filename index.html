        <h2> Athletics 🏃🏻‍♂️</h2>
        	<p>
        		I've been a big fan of athletics since I was a kid, and did it for nearly 10 years, specialising in middle-distance running, especially cross-country. I was also departmental cross-country champion in 2018.

        <h2>Football ⚽</h2>
          <p>
            I've also been a big football fan since I was a kid, supporting Olympique Lyonnais since I was very young thanks to my father, who is also a big fan of the club despite the fact that I've lived in Paris since I was born. I watch all my club's matches, it's a great passion of mine.

        <h2>Travelling ✈️</h2>
          <p>
            I've loved travelling since I was a child, as it allows me to discover completely new landscapes and cultures. I've been lucky enough to travel many times with my family, and the trip that particularly impressed me was a trip to improve my English with a family in Chicago, which was an exceptional experience for me.

        <h2>Music 🎶</h2>
          <p>
            I've had a passion for music since I was a kid. I started listening to pop music as a child, then rap, and I've recently opened up to all types of music and now enjoy music of all styles. I listen to music absolutely every day, it punctuates my days and motivates me.

        <h2>Tennis 🥎</h2>
          <p>
            I've been a big tennis fan for a few years now. I played club tennis for a few years, but I also played a lot with my friends, especially in matches. In the summer of 2023, I took part in my very first tennis tournament, which enabled me to be ranked 30.1.
